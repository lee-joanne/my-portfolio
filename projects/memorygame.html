            <h2 class="fw-bold">Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Many beginner-friendly JavaScript games, including memory games,
              often overlook robust error handling and code reliability. This
              leads to buggy behaviour, poor user experience, and limited
              scalability. There is a need for a well-structured, bug-free
              JavaScript game that not only offers an engaging experience but
              also demonstrates best practices in development, including
              thoughtful error handling and clean, maintainable code.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h2 class="fw-bold">Solution</h2>
            <p>
              To address the lack of JavaScript games with proper error handling
              and user-focused design, I created a Studio Ghibli-themed memory
              game using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and
              <strong>JavaScript</strong>. The goal was to go beyond a basic
              game by implementing thoughtful error handling to ensure smooth
              and bug-free gameplay. I conducted usability testing to gather
              feedback and understand how real users interact with the game,
              which informed improvements to both functionality and interface. I
              also researched best practices in front-end error management to
              strengthen the game's reliability and code structure.

            <p>
              As a solo designer and developer, my primary goal for Memory Game
              was to create a fun, engaging, and visually appealing interactive
              experience using JavaScript. I wanted to build a game that many
              users would instantly recognize and enjoy, so I chose the classic
              memory matching game format. By focusing on smooth gameplay,
              charming illustrations, and a clean, thoughtful design, I aimed to
              make the experience approachable for players of all ages. The
              project was designed not only to entertain but also to showcase
              how playful interactions and appealing visuals can come together
              to create an enjoyable and memorable web experience.

            <h2 class="fw-bold">Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>
              For the competitive analysis of Memory Game, I reviewed a variety
              of homemade JavaScript memory games available online. While many
              offered basic gameplay, I noticed common issues such as frequent
              bugs, lack of robust error handling, and weak user input
              validation. These shortcomings sometimes allowed users to
              manipulate the game to cheat or caused the game to behave
              unpredictably, detracting from the overall experience. This
              insight informed my approach to building a more polished and
              reliable game, with careful attention to error handling, game
              state management, and a smooth, bug-free user experience.

            <p>
              Memory Game is designed for all users, from casual players and
              beginners to those looking for a quick, fun challenge. Its
              intuitive interface and clear instructions make it easy to pick up
              and play, even for users unfamiliar with digital games. To ensure
              the best experience, the game is optimized primarily for desktop
              use, as the larger screen and precise controls offer smoother
              gameplay compared to mobile devices. Accessibility and simplicity
              were key priorities, with a focus on straightforward interactions
              and helpful information to guide users through the game without
              frustration. When correct matches are made, a sound would be
              triggered to alert users.

            <h4>Paper Wireframes</h4>
            <p>
              I started with hand-drawn wireframes to swiftly map out layout and
              user flow concepts without focusing on detailed visuals. This
              approach allowed me to quickly brainstorm and sketch essential
              screens like the homepage, information page, and card layout.

              I began by sketching the user flow on paper to quickly outline the

              the core screens, such as the homepage, information page, and
              cards layout, and ensure a smooth experience before diving into
              visuals or code. Mapping things out by hand allowed me to focus on

            The Studio Ghibli Memory Game style guide features a playful yet
            cohesive aesthetic. A soft, charming colour palette of pastel
            greens, whites, blacks, and greys ensures strong contrast and visual
            clarity. Typography pairs the cursive
            <strong>Darumadrop One</strong> for headings, evoking the cuteness
            and warmth of the Studio Ghibli universe, with the clean, modern
            <strong>Rubik</strong> for body text to maintain readability and
            structure. Imagery and icons reflect the fantastical, storybook-like
            quality of Ghibli films, enhancing the game's charm while
            maintaining usability. Together, these choices create a magical,
            user-friendly experience that appeals to fans and newcomers alike.

            <h4>Colour Palette</h4>
            <p>
              The colour palette for the Studio Ghibli Memory Game draws
              inspiration from the enchanting, forest-filled worlds of Ghibli
              films. A rich, earthy green was chosen as the primary colour to
              reflect the natural tones of the studio’s iconic landscapes. This
              is complemented by a neutral dark grey used as an accent to add
              depth and subtle contrast throughout the interface. A clean white
              acts as the secondary colour, ensuring clarity and visual balance
              without overwhelming the charm of the design. Together, these
              colours create an immersive, playful experience that captures the
              spirit of Studio Ghibli while remaining accessible and engaging.

          <p>
            The final Studio Ghibli Memory Game is a robust, functional
            JavaScript matching game that brings charm and playfulness to the
            user experience. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game
            features a fully functional layout, intuitive card-flipping
            animations, and a clean interface inspired by the charming nature of
            Studio Ghibli films. The user's turns increase after each pair of
            flips and the timer countdown decreases per second as intended.
            Through usability testing, I was able to uncover edge cases and
            friction points that weren’t initially apparent, allowing me to
            iterate on key interactions and ensure smoother gameplay. I also
            carried out continuous manual testing across a range of devices and
            browsers to verify consistent performance. These efforts led to
            subtle but impactful refinements, such as tweaking animation speeds,
            adjusting button placement, and improving visual feedback after
            matches, all of which enhanced the game’s overall feel. As both
            designer and developer, I worked from wireframes through to a
            polished final product, ensuring that each detail contributed to a
            joyful, accessible experience aligned with the spirit of Ghibli’s
            storytelling.

                The primary goal was to test for a range of real-world use cases
                that may have been overlooked during development. With the first
                deployment as my prototype, I aimed to evaluate how users
                interacted with the platform across different devices (laptops
                and desktops), browsers, internet speeds, and skill levels. This
                included identifying any pain points related to responsiveness,
                accessibility, and error handling under varying conditions. By
                observing diverse usage scenarios, I could uncover usability
                issues that might not appear in ideal environments.

                I conducted both <strong>moderated</strong> and
                <strong>unmoderated</strong> usability tests to gather a wide
                range of feedback. The moderated sessions took place in person,
                where I observed users as they interacted with the memory game
                and encouraged them to think aloud while completing tasks such
                as matching pairs, experimenting with mismatches, and exploring
                game mechanics like what happens when you unmatch a pair. For
                the unmoderated sessions, participants completed the same tasks
                remotely, with sessions lasting 15–20 minutes and screen
                recordings captured for later review. This mixed approach
                allowed for both real-time observation and natural user
                behaviour analysis in different environments.

                reflect the likely audience for a lightweight browser-based

                Usability testing revealed small but meaningful issues that I
                hadn’t anticipated, like confusion around closing the modal or
                unexpected browser bugs. It reminded me how important it is to
                test with real users early and often and never assume a feature
                is self-explanatory. These insights helped me improve both the
                game’s clarity and overall accessibility.

                I prepared for a smooth developer handoff by organizing all
                design assets, style guides, and interaction notes in one place.
                The codebase was modular and reusable, with clear structure for
                easy maintenance. I used Git and GitHub for version control and
                collaboration, and ensured the game was fully tested across
                devices and browsers. The project was deployed with a simple,
                repeatable process to support future updates.

                I carried out both manual and usability testing to ensure the
                game functioned reliably on desktop browsers. Manual testing
                focused on verifying navigation flow, gameplay accuracy, and
                overall feature stability. Usability testing provided real user
                insights, revealing interaction issues like unclear modal
                behaviour and a browser-specific bug with matched pairs, which
                were addressed to improve the experience.

          This project taught me how valuable real user input is, especially
          when it highlights things I completely overlooked as both the designer
          and developer. It was interesting to see how differently users
          interacted with features I thought were intuitive. As I focused
          heavily on design, I realized that translating visual ideas into
          working code brings its own set of challenges. In future projects, I
          want to prioritize accessibility and expand to mobile screens,
          especially as mobile use continues to grow. I will also prepare
          high-fidelity wireframes to be prototyped before the development
          process to catch any edge cases early.
