        <p>
          Many beginner-friendly JavaScript games, including memory games, often
          overlook robust error handling and code reliability. This leads to
          buggy behaviour, poor user experience, and limited scalability. There
          is a need for a well-structured, bug-free JavaScript game that not
          only offers an engaging experience but also demonstrates best
          practices in development, including thoughtful error handling and
          clean, maintainable code.

        <h1 class="fw-bold mb-2">The Solution</h1>
        <p>
          To address the lack of JavaScript games with proper error handling and
          user-focused design, I created a Studio Ghibli-themed memory game
          using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and
          <strong>JavaScript</strong>. The goal was to go beyond a basic game by
          implementing thoughtful error handling to ensure smooth and bug-free
          gameplay. I conducted usability testing to gather feedback and
          understand how real users interact with the game, which informed
          improvements to both functionality and interface. I also researched
          best practices in front-end error management to strengthen the game's
          reliability and code structure.

            <h3 class="fw-bold">Kickoff</h3>
            <p>
              As a solo developer, I started by researching classic memory games
              to grasp their core mechanics and what makes them enjoyable. While
              exploring existing JavaScript versions, I noticed many were easily
              manipulated, which motivated me to focus on creating a more
              reliable and fair game. I carefully planned the visual design to
              make it appealing and studied JavaScript best practices to
              implement solid, maintainable code from the outset.

            <h3 class="fw-bold">Target Users & Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              I identified the target users for Memory Game as casual players
              and beginners seeking a simple, enjoyable pastime, as well as
              those looking for a quick, engaging challenge. Understanding that
              many players might be unfamiliar with digital games, I focused on
              creating an intuitive interface with clear instructions to make
              the game accessible to all skill levels. Recognizing that desktop
              users benefit from larger screens and precise controls, I
              optimized the game primarily for desktop play, while prioritizing
              accessibility and simplicity to minimize frustration and maximize
              enjoyment.

            <h3 class="fw-bold">Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              For the competitive analysis of Memory Game, I reviewed a variety
              of homemade JavaScript memory games available online. While many
              offered basic gameplay, I noticed common issues such as frequent
              bugs, lack of robust error handling, and weak user input
              validation. These shortcomings sometimes allowed users to
              manipulate the game to cheat or caused the game to behave
              unpredictably, detracting from the overall experience. This
              insight informed my approach to building a more polished and
              reliable game, with careful attention to error handling, game
              state management, and a smooth, bug-free user experience.

          <p>
            In this project, I chose to create only paper wireframes as a
            foundational step to keep my focus sharp on designing a clear and
            intuitive user flow. This hands-on approach helped me carefully
            consider proper error handling and user interactions before moving
            into development, ensuring the experience would be smooth and
            frustration-free.

            <h4>Paper Wireframes</h4>
            <p>
              I started with hand-drawn wireframes to swiftly map out layout and
              user flow concepts without focusing on detailed visuals. This
              approach allowed me to quickly brainstorm and sketch essential
              screens like the homepage, information page, and card layout.

          <p>
            I created the style guide for the Studio Ghibli Memory Game to evoke
            a playful yet cohesive aesthetic. I chose a soft, charming colour
            palette of pastel greens, whites, blacks, and greys to ensure strong
            contrast and clear visuals. For typography, I paired the cursive
            <strong>Darumadrop One</strong> for headings, capturing the warmth
            and whimsy of the Studio Ghibli world, with the clean, modern
            <strong>Rubik</strong>
            for body text to keep readability and structure. I selected imagery
            and icons that reflect the fantastical, storybook quality of Ghibli
            films to enhance the game’s charm while maintaining usability. These
            design choices combine to create a magical and user-friendly
            experience that appeals to both fans and newcomers.

            <p>
              The colour palette for the Studio Ghibli Memory Game draws
              inspiration from the enchanting, forest-filled worlds of Ghibli
              films. A rich, earthy green was chosen as the primary colour to
              reflect the natural tones of the studio’s iconic landscapes. This
              is complemented by a neutral dark grey used as an accent to add
              depth and subtle contrast throughout the interface. A clean white
              acts as the secondary colour, ensuring clarity and visual balance
              without overwhelming the charm of the design. Together, these
              colours create an immersive, playful experience that captures the
              spirit of Studio Ghibli while remaining accessible and engaging.

                The primary goal was to test for a range of real-world use cases
                that may have been overlooked during development. With the first
                deployment as my prototype, I aimed to evaluate how users
                interacted with the platform across different devices (laptops
                and desktops), browsers, internet speeds, and skill levels. This
                included identifying any pain points related to responsiveness,
                accessibility, and error handling under varying conditions. By
                observing diverse usage scenarios, I could uncover usability
                issues that might not appear in ideal environments.

                I conducted both <strong>moderated</strong> and
                <strong>unmoderated</strong> usability tests to gather a wide
                range of feedback. The moderated sessions took place in person,
                where I observed users as they interacted with the memory game
                and encouraged them to think aloud while completing tasks such
                as matching pairs, experimenting with mismatches, and exploring
                game mechanics like what happens when you unmatch a pair.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-0">
                For the unmoderated sessions, participants completed the same
                tasks remotely, with sessions lasting
                <strong>15–20 minutes</strong> and screen recordings captured
                for later review. This mixed approach allowed for both real-time
                observation and natural user behaviour analysis in different
                environments.

        <p>
          The final Studio Ghibli Memory Game is a robust, functional JavaScript
          matching game that brings charm and playfulness to the user
          experience. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game features a
          fully functional layout, intuitive card-flipping animations, and a
          clean interface inspired by the enchanting spirit of Studio Ghibli
          films. The user’s turns increment correctly after each pair of flips,
          and the timer countdown decreases per second as intended, ensuring
          engaging and smooth gameplay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through usability testing, I uncovered edge cases and friction points
          that were not initially apparent. This allowed me to iterate on key
          interactions and enhance the overall experience. Continuous manual
          testing across multiple devices and browsers helped verify consistent
          performance and responsiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on user feedback, I implemented several targeted improvements:
          matched pairs are now locked by completely removing event listeners to
          prevent a browser-specific bug that allowed dragging unmatched pairs;
          the information modal screen was updated with small instructional text
          informing users that clicking outside the modal closes it; text sizes
          and colors were adjusted to improve contrast and accessibility; and a
          ‘chime’ sound was added to signal correctly matched pairs, providing
          clearer visual and auditory feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also conducted follow-up interviews with the same five participants
          using the latest version of the game. These sessions confirmed the
          effectiveness of the improvements, with users reporting a more
          intuitive, enjoyable experience and fewer usability issues. Overall,
          the iterative process of design, development, and testing ensured a
          polished final product that delivers a joyful, accessible, and
          thematically resonant experience aligned with the storytelling magic
          of Studio Ghibli.

        <p class="mb-0">
          This project taught me how valuable real user input is, especially
          when it highlights things I completely overlooked as both the designer
          and developer. It was interesting to see how differently users
          interacted with features I thought were intuitive. As I focused
          heavily on design, I realized that translating visual ideas into
          working code brings its own set of challenges. In future projects, I
          want to prioritize accessibility and expand to mobile screens,
          especially as mobile use continues to grow. I will also prepare
          high-fidelity wireframes to be prototyped before the development
          process to catch any edge cases early.
