            <p>
              The holiday season is a time for sharing meals and creating
              festive memories, yet users often struggle to find
              Christmas-themed recipe websites that are both interactive and
              diverse in content. Many existing sites offer limited seasonal
              options, static content, or overwhelming user interfaces that make
              it hard to stay engaged or inspired. As part of Code Institute's
              2023 Christmas Hackathon, the challenge was to design and develop
              a digital solution that allows users to explore a variety of
              festive recipes with ease, interactivity, and a touch of seasonal
              magic.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h2 class="fw-bold">Solution</h2>
            <p>
              To address this challenge, I collaborated with a team of six to
              design and develop HolyRecipes, an intuitive, user-friendly
              Christmas recipe website built with <strong>HTML</strong>,
              <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Our goal
              was to create a festive, interactive platform where users could
              easily browse a wide variety of Christmas-themed dishes and search
              by category or ingredients with a built-in API. The site features
              a clean, accessible UI, dynamic filtering, and clear recipe
              presentation that encourages exploration without overwhelming the
              user.

            <h2 class="fw-bold">Kickoff</h2>
            <p>
              Our team of six had just three days to bring HolyRecipes to life
              as part of Code Institute’s Christmas Hackathon. We began with a
              collaborative kickoff call where we brainstormed ideas, discussed
              user needs based on the problem statement, and ideated potential
              design and technical solutions. Embracing Agile methods, we
              quickly organized our workflow using a shared Kanban board to
              break the project into manageable tasks. This allowed us to move
              efficiently from ideation to implementation, assigning roles,
              setting daily check-ins, and maintaining flexibility as we built
              the core features of the site. Our goal was to combine creativity
              and usability in a festive, functional recipe platform tailored to
              the holiday season.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h2 class="fw-bold">Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>
              As part of the research phase, we conducted a competitive analysis
              of popular recipe websites such as AllRecipes, BBC Good Food, and
              Tasty. While these platforms offer extensive collections of
              recipes, they tend to lack a strong focus on seasonal or
              holiday-specific content, often requiring users to sift through
              unrelated results. Many also prioritize quantity over user
              experience, featuring cluttered layouts, pop-up ads, and complex
              navigation. We noticed a gap in the market for a festive, focused,
              and user-friendly platform dedicated entirely to Christmas
              recipes. HolyRecipes was designed to fill that space by combining
              a curated collection of holiday dishes with a clean interface and
              intuitive browsing experience.

            <h2 class="fw-bold">Target Users & Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
              HolyRecipes is built to be an all-in-one platform for anyone
              looking to bring festive cheer into their kitchen, whether they’re
              beginners searching for their first Christmas cookie recipe or
              seasoned cooks planning an elaborate holiday feast. With a
              built-in recipe API, users can instantly search and explore a wide
              variety of Christmas dishes with just a click, removing the need
              to visit multiple sites or filter through irrelevant results. The
              platform caters to busy users who want quick inspiration, as well
              as those who enjoy browsing and planning meals. Designed with
              accessibility in mind, HolyRecipes features a responsive layout,
              semantic HTML, clear navigation, and strong colour contrast,
              making it easy to use across all devices and for users of all
              abilities. No sign-ups or technical barriers required.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Users are more likely to engage with recipe content when it's
                instantly searchable and visually appealing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Holiday chefs appreciate curated, seasonal content over generic,
                year-round recipes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Removing sign-up requirements lowers friction and encourages
                spontaneous browsing.
              </li>
              <li>
                A clean, festive interface builds trust and enhances the overall
                holiday experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                Mobile accessibility is crucial, as many users cook directly
                from their phones or tablets.

          <p>
            For the hackathon, I took on the role of wireframer for the team.
            Given the tight three-day deadline, I focused on quickly sketching
            paper wireframes to map out key screens and user flows. This rapid,
            low-fidelity approach allowed me to visualize the site’s structure
            and core features without getting bogged down in details. I
            presented these sketches to the team early on to gather feedback and
            iterate the design, ensuring alignment before development began.
            This efficient process helped us maintain momentum and build a
            functional, user-friendly application within the limited timeframe.

            <h4>Paper Wireframes</h4>
            <p>
              I began with hand-drawn wireframes to rapidly explore layout and
              user flow options without getting tied down to visual details.
              This allowed me to quickly ideate and sketch key screens including
              the homepage, popular recipes section, an ‘About Us’ page to build
              user trust, the recipe search powered by the API, and a contact
              page. These sketches provided a clear blueprint for the site’s
              structure and prioritized user needs, enabling swift team feedback
              and iteration before moving into development.

          <h2 class="fw-bold">Style Guide</h2>
          <p>
            The style guide establishes the visual identity and ensures
            consistency across the site. The primary font,
            <strong>Kalnia</strong>, was chosen for its decorative serif style
            that conveys a festive, holiday feel distinct from typical web
            fonts, aligning with seasonal design trends. Complementing this, the
            secondary font, <strong>Poppins</strong>, provides clean readability
            and a professional tone that builds user trust in the content. The
            colour scheme draws from classic Christmas colours, using vibrant
            greens for main navigation elements and festive reds for interactive
            states like button hovers. Softer green tones highlight link
            interactions, ensuring clear visual feedback. Together, these
            choices create an inviting, accessible, and coherent design language
            throughout the platform.

            <h4>Colour Palette</h4>
            <p>
              The colour palette draws from traditional holiday hues to create
              an instantly recognizable festive atmosphere. The primary colour
              is Christmas tree green, featured prominently in the main
              navigation areas like the navbar, footer, and action buttons.
              Santa red serves as the secondary colour, used especially as a
              button hover effect to signal interactivity. Yellow accents add
              warmth and highlight decorative elements throughout the site,
              enhancing the cheerful and vibrant holiday feel.

            Our team successfully completed an inclusive, fully responsive
            design within the three-day hackathon timeframe. The website
            features vibrant colours and festive imagery, with highlighted
            recipes showcased on the homepage alongside popular dishes. The
            About page shares family traditions and introduces users to the
            creators, fostering trust and connection. A dedicated Contact page
            allows users to easily send queries. The site’s powerful search
            functionality leverages a built-in API, enabling users to find
            recipes by name, category, or dietary restrictions quickly and
            intuitively. After finalizing the project, we presented our work to
            the judges and were honoured to receive second place for our
            efforts.

                As a team, we ensured a smooth handoff by maintaining clear
                communication and collaboration throughout the project. We held
                daily calls to coordinate progress and address any challenges,
                while using a Kanban board to clearly separate and track
                individual tasks. This organized approach helped us stay aligned
                and efficiently share responsibilities. Each member contributed
                equally, and we maintained well-structured, reusable code to
                promote consistency. Our use of version control with Git and
                GitHub enabled seamless collaboration and easy tracking of
                changes, ensuring the project could be easily updated or handed
                off in the future.

                Testing and quality assurance were a shared responsibility
                across the team. We all manually tested the site on a variety of
                devices, including phones, tablets, and desktops, to ensure
                consistent responsiveness and functionality. Navigation was
                carefully reviewed to confirm that it worked intuitively across
                screen sizes, and recipe searches were tested thoroughly to
                ensure accurate results. We also validated form inputs and
                interactions to make sure the user experience was smooth and
                error-free. This hands-on, collaborative approach helped us

          This was my first project where I worked collaboratively within a team
          under a tight three-day deadline. While the pace was challenging, the
          experience was incredibly rewarding, especially as our project earned
          second place in the hackathon. Collaborating with others allowed us to
          bounce ideas off one another, share responsibilities, and push the
          project further than any one of us could have done alone. I also came
          to appreciate the unique benefits of both solo and team work:
          individual projects allow for deeper focus and creative control, while
          team efforts encourage fresh perspectives, faster iteration, and
          shared learning. Overall, this project taught me the value of
          collaboration, time management, and trusting in the strengths of the
          people around you.
