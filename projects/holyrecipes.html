        <p>
          In this team project, we designed and built HolyRecipes, a festive
          recipe-sharing website created for Code Institute’s 2023 Christmas
          Hackathon, where it earned <strong>second place</strong>. The platform
          celebrates seasonal cooking by offering users a cozy, visually
          inviting space to browse and contribute holiday recipes. From desserts
          to traditional mains, HolyRecipes emphasizes community-driven content
          without the clutter. Throughout the build, we tackled challenges
          around dynamic content handling, responsive UI design, and intuitive
          navigation to ensure a joyful user experience across all devices. The
          result is a warm, festive hub that brings people together through food
          and celebration.

        <p>
          The holiday season is a time for sharing meals and creating festive
          memories, yet users often struggle to find Christmas-themed recipe
          websites that are both interactive and diverse in content. Many
          existing sites offer limited seasonal options, static content, or
          overwhelming user interfaces that make it hard to stay engaged or
          inspired. As part of Code Institute's 2023 Christmas Hackathon, the
          challenge was to design and develop a digital solution that allows
          users to explore a variety of festive recipes with ease,
          interactivity, and a touch of seasonal magic.

                Many recipe websites offer generic content year-round, making it
                difficult for users to find curated, holiday-specific dishes

        <p>
          To address this challenge, I collaborated with a team of six to design
          and develop HolyRecipes, an intuitive, user-friendly Christmas recipe
          website built with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and
          <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Our goal was to create a festive,
          interactive platform where users could easily browse a wide variety of
          Christmas-themed dishes and search by category or ingredients with a
          built-in API. The site features a clean, accessible UI, dynamic
          filtering, and clear recipe presentation that encourages exploration
          without overwhelming the user.

            <h3 class="fw-bold">Kickoff</h3>
            <p>
              Our team of six had just three days to build HolyRecipes for Code
              Institute’s Christmas Hackathon. We kicked off with a
              collaborative call to brainstorm ideas, define user needs, and
              align on design and technical solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              We used Agile methods and created a Kanban board to break down the
              work into clear tasks, assigned roles, and held daily check-ins.
              This approach helped us stay flexible and focused as we built a
              festive, user-friendly platform in a short timeframe.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3 class="fw-bold">Target Users & Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              We clearly defined our target users as a broad range of home
              cooks, from beginners trying their first Christmas cookie recipe
              to experienced chefs planning festive meals. Understanding their
              needs helped us focus on creating an accessible, easy-to-use
              platform that provides relevant, holiday-specific recipes.
            </p>
            <p>
              By catering to both busy users seeking quick inspiration and those
              who enjoy exploring in detail, HolyRecipes offers a joyful and
              inclusive cooking experience without requiring sign-ups or
              technical know-how.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3 class="fw-bold">Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              During the research phase, we analyzed recipe sites like
              AllRecipes, BBC Good Food, and Tasty. While they offer large
              collections, they often lack a clear focus on holiday content and
              can overwhelm users with cluttered layouts, ads, and complex
              navigation.
            </p>

            <p>
              We identified a gap for a festive, user-friendly platform
              dedicated entirely to Christmas recipes. HolyRecipes fills that
              need with a curated holiday collection, clean design, and
              intuitive browsing experience.

          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3 class="fw-bold">Key Insights</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>

          <h3 class="fw-bold">Wireframes</h3>
          <p>
            For the hackathon, I took on the role of wireframer for the team.
            Given the tight three-day deadline, I focused on quickly sketching
            paper wireframes to map out key screens and user flows. This rapid,
            low-fidelity approach allowed me to visualize the site’s structure
            and core features without getting bogged down in details. I
            presented these sketches to the team early on to gather feedback and
            iterate the design, ensuring alignment before development began.
            This efficient process helped us maintain momentum and build a
            functional, user-friendly application within the limited timeframe.

            <h4>Paper Wireframes</h4>
            <p>
              I began with hand-drawn wireframes to rapidly explore layout and
              user flow options without getting tied down to visual details.
              This allowed me to quickly ideate and sketch key screens including
              the homepage, popular recipes section, an ‘About Us’ page to build
              user trust, the recipe search powered by the API, and a contact
              page. These sketches provided a clear blueprint for the site’s
              structure and prioritized user needs, enabling swift team feedback
              and iteration before moving into development.

            We collaborated to create a style guide that established a

            <strong>Kalnia</strong>, adds a decorative, holiday feel, while the
            secondary font, <strong>Poppins</strong>, ensures clean readability
            and builds user trust.

          <p>
            Our colour palette draws from classic Christmas tones, consisting of
            vibrant greens for navigation, festive reds for interactive
            elements, and softer greens for links to offer clear feedback and a
            joyful, accessible user experience.

              The colour palette draws from traditional holiday hues to create
              an instantly recognizable festive atmosphere. The primary colour
              is Christmas tree green, featured prominently in the main
              navigation areas like the navbar, footer, and action buttons.
              Santa red serves as the secondary colour, used especially as a
              button hover effect to signal interactivity. Yellow accents add
              warmth and highlight decorative elements throughout the site,
              enhancing the cheerful and vibrant holiday feel.

                Testing and quality assurance were a shared responsibility

                devices, including phones, tablets, and desktops, to ensure
                consistent responsiveness and functionality. Navigation was
                carefully reviewed to confirm that it worked intuitively across
                screen sizes, and recipe searches were tested thoroughly to
                ensure accurate results. We also validated form inputs and
                interactions to make sure the user experience was smooth and
                error-free. This hands-on, collaborative approach helped us
                catch minor bugs early and deliver a polished, reliable final
                product.

          Our team successfully completed an inclusive, fully responsive design
          within the three-day hackathon timeframe. The website features vibrant
          colours and festive imagery, with highlighted recipes showcased on the
          homepage alongside popular dishes. The About page shares family
          traditions and introduces users to the creators, fostering trust and
          connection. A dedicated Contact page allows users to easily send
          queries. The site’s powerful search functionality leverages a built-in
          API, enabling users to find recipes by name, category, or dietary
          restrictions quickly and intuitively. After finalizing the project, we
          presented our work to the judges and were honoured to receive second
          place for our efforts.

          This was my first project where I worked collaboratively within a team
          under a tight three-day deadline. While the pace was challenging, the
          experience was incredibly rewarding, especially as our project earned
          second place in the hackathon. Collaborating with others allowed us to
          bounce ideas off one another, share responsibilities, and push the
          project further than any one of us could have done alone. I also came
          to appreciate the unique benefits of both solo and team work:
          individual projects allow for deeper focus and creative control, while
          team efforts encourage fresh perspectives, faster iteration, and
          shared learning. Overall, this project taught me the value of
          collaboration, time management, and trusting in the strengths of the
          people around you.
