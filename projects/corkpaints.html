            <h2 class="fw-bold">Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Cork, Ireland is home to a vibrant and growing arts community, yet
              finding and booking local painting workshops can be surprisingly
              difficult. Many existing options are scattered across library
              websites, social media pages, or require complicated sign-up
              processes involving email confirmations or third-party platforms.
              This fragmented experience makes it harder for both newcomers and
              seasoned artists to discover and join workshops in their area.
              There was a clear need for a centralized, user-friendly way to
              explore and express interest in creative events without
              unnecessary friction.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h2 class="fw-bold">Solution</h2>
            <p>
              To address this gap, I created a simple, accessible workshop
              booking platform using <strong>HTML</strong>,
              <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. The site is
              designed to reflect the spirit of Cork’s artistic culture while
              making it easy for users to browse available painting workshops
              and register their interest through a straightforward form. While
              the form does not submit data to a backend, the project
              demonstrates the ideal user journey, consisting of clear workshop
              listings, clean UI, and a no-hassle registration process. This
              prototype envisions a more inclusive and approachable way for
              people to connect with Cork’s creative scene.

            <p>
              As a solo designer and developer, my primary goal for Cork Paints
              was to simplify the experience of discovering and registering for
              local painting workshops. I wanted users to be able to sign up
              without creating accounts, making phone calls, or sending emails,
              but just selecting a workshop and confirming their interest in a
              few easy clicks. The project was designed to strip away common
              booking roadblocks and make creative opportunities feel more
              approachable and spontaneous.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h2 class="fw-bold">Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>
              I conducted a competitive audit of art institutions in Cork,
              including Shandon Art Studios, Crawford Art Gallery, and Cork
              College of FET. While these organizations offer high-quality
              workshops led by experienced instructors, I identified several
              friction points: limited seasonal availability, high costs, and
              registration methods that required creating accounts, long wait
              times, or direct communication via email or phone. These models
              cater well to committed learners but can deter beginners or
              impulsive bookers looking for a quick creative outlet.

          <h2 class="fw-bold">Wireframes</h2>
          <p>
            In the initial design phase for Cork Paints, I embraced a
            mobile-first mindset by sketching key screens and user flows on
            paper. This hands-on approach enabled me to quickly explore layout
            options, prioritize essential booking steps, and establish a clear
            visual hierarchy. These early sketches acted as a tactile
            brainstorming tool, helping to clarify how users would navigate
            workshop selections and registrations with minimal friction. Once
            the core flow felt intuitive, I digitized these concepts into
            low-fidelity wireframes using a simple tool, focusing on clean
            layouts and straightforward interactions. This foundational work
            ensured the final design stayed user-friendly and accessible,
            supporting a seamless and inviting workshop booking experience.

            <h4>Paper Wireframes</h4>
            <p>
              I began with hand-drawn wireframes to quickly explore layout and
              flow options without committing to visuals. This helped me rapidly
              ideate and sketch out key screens such as the homepage, courses
              page, and the registration form.

            The style guide for Cork Paints features a harmonious colour palette
            of purple, white, and dark grey, ensuring strong contrast and
            readability. Typography combines the bold, modern
            <strong>Montserrat</strong> for headings with the elegant, readable
            serif <strong>Lora</strong> for body text, creating a balanced and
            inviting look. Imagery focuses on minimalistic, artistic photos that
            complement the colour scheme and reinforce the creative,
            painting-focused theme of the site. Together, these elements deliver
            a clean, accessible, and visually appealing user experience.

              The logo was from Font Awesome. The goal was to feature a fun

              The colour palette for Cork Paints features a soft, pastel purple
              as the primary colour, chosen for its calming, creative tone and
              visual appeal. This is paired with clean white and a deep
              grey-black to maintain strong contrast and a minimalist aesthetic.
              The combination creates an inviting and accessible interface that
              highlights content without overwhelming the user, perfect for a
              creative platform focused on artistic expression and ease of use.

          <p>
            The final Cork Paints product reflects the core goals of simplicity,
            creativity, and accessibility. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
            the site features a fully responsive layout, a smooth booking form,
            and clear navigation to guide users through available workshops.
            Throughout the development process, I continuously tested the site
            across devices and browsers to ensure consistent performance. After
            launching an initial version, I gathered informal feedback from a
            handful of target users, including students and casual hobbyists,
            who tested the booking flow and navigation. Based on their insights,
            I made several small but meaningful iterations, such as refining
            button placements, improving course card layouts, and enhancing
            overall readability. These adjustments helped reinforce the site’s
            purpose: to make discovering and booking painting workshops in Cork
            quick, intuitive, and welcoming for all experience levels. As both
            designer and developer, I worked iteratively from low-fidelity
            wireframes to polished UI, ensuring that every feature aligned with
            real user needs and the project’s original vision.

        <p>
          This being my first coding project, I learned firsthand that great
          ideas really can come to life with persistence and continuous
          learning. While I didn’t have all the technical skills at the time to
          build a fully functional workshop booking system, the process taught
          me the importance of starting simple and iterating. Today, with
          improved skills and experience, I’m confident I could develop a
          complete, production-ready platform, including real-time form
          submissions to a database, user authentication, and dynamic workshop
          management. This project fueled my passion for turning concepts into
          tangible solutions and showed me that every big achievement begins
          with a single step in coding and design.
