            <h2 class="fw-bold">Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Many JavaScript-based games, especially those targeting beginners,
              tend to suffer from buggy functionality, lack of proper error
              handling, and poorly structured code. Additionally, they often
              fail to implement progressive difficulty, which can lead to user
              boredom and reduced engagement over time. There's a clear need for
              a well-built, scalable and simple game that not only provides an
              engaging and educational experience, but also follows modern
              JavaScript best practices, including clean code, thoughtful error
              handling, and a difficulty curve that keeps players challenged and
              motivated.

            <h2 class="fw-bold">Solution</h2>
            <p>
              To address the common issues of unreliable code and stagnant
              difficulty in JavaScript games, I built a geography-based game,
              called Geo Quiz, using <strong>HTML</strong>,
              <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. The game
              was designed to scale in difficulty as users progress, maintaining
              engagement while testing their geography knowledge. I implemented
              thorough error handling and followed front-end best practices to
              ensure clean, maintainable code. To validate its performance and
              user experience, I conducted both usability testing and manual
              testing, using real feedback to refine the interface, logic, and
              overall gameplay for a smooth and enjoyable experience.

            <p>
              As a solo designer and developer, Geo Quiz was my first ever
              JavaScript project. It required a great deal of practice,
              learning, and discipline to develop the skills necessary to
              integrate JavaScript functionality with HTML and CSS. I chose to
              create a geography-based quiz because it’s a universally relatable
              topic. People from around the world can engage with general
              geography questions, making the game widely accessible. This
              project was not only a milestone in my JavaScript journey but also
              a chance to build something educational, interactive, and globally
              relevant while honing my front-end development skills.

            <h2 class="fw-bold">Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>
              For the competitive analysis of Geo Quiz, I reviewed a range of
              beginner-friendly JavaScript quiz games. While many were creative,
              they often lacked proper error handling, had minimal difficulty
              progression, or included bugs due to weak game logic. I also
              noticed that many were themed around niche topics like TV shows or
              pop culture, which can limit their appeal. To ensure broader
              accessibility, I chose a geography-based theme, which is something
              universally relatable, and focused on building a clean, reliable
              game that offers a smooth, engaging experience for all users.

              Geo Quiz is designed for all users, from casual players and
              beginners to those looking for a quick, fun challenge.
              Accessibility and simplicity were key priorities throughout
              development. The game is fully responsive for both desktop and
              mobile devices, ensuring a smooth experience across screen sizes.
              Clear feedback is provided after each question to let users know
              if their answer was correct or not, along with the correct answer
              when needed. Proper error handling was implemented to ensure the
              game communicates effectively with users, creating an intuitive
              and frustration-free experience that encourages continued play.

              I started with hand-drawn wireframes to map out layout and user
              flow concepts without focusing on detailed visuals. This approach
              allowed me to quickly brainstorm and sketch essential screens like
              the homepage, how instructions will be portrayed to the user, the
              game layout, and how the buttons will be interacted.

            The style guide uses a harmonious palette of blues, white, and black
            to create a calm, accessible look that fits the geography theme.
            Blue shades highlight buttons and containers, while white text
            ensures readability. Black accents enhance clarity for icons and
            controls. The typography features <strong>Dosis</strong>, a playful
            and readable rounded sans-serif font that suits the game’s friendly
            vibe. The background image of blue skies and Greek architecture
            supports the theme and keeps the layout clean and inviting.

              White text ensures readability and accessibility, while some black
              accents emphasize interactive elements. This combination creates a

              <p class="mb-0">
                The primary goal of testing Geo Quiz was to ensure key
                functionalities worked reliably across real-world scenarios.
                With the first deployment as my prototype, I focused on
                verifying that questions shuffled correctly, answer buttons
                disabled appropriately after selection, and the score accurately
                updated. Additionally, I tested that users were correctly
                passing or failing each level based on their performance. The
                game’s responsiveness was also evaluated across various screen
                sizes and devices to ensure a smooth experience for all users.
                This comprehensive testing helped identify and resolve issues
                related to usability, responsiveness, and game logic under
                diverse conditions.

              <h2 class="fw-bold">Methodology</h2>
              <p class="mb-0">
                I conducted <strong>moderated</strong> usability tests lasting
                10–15 minutes each, where I guided users through a series of
                tasks and questions. Participants were asked to perform actions
                such as finding out how many points are needed to reach level 3,
                attempting to manipulate the answer buttons, answering all
                questions correctly, and intentionally failing. These sessions
                provided valuable insights into how users interact with the
                game’s mechanics and helped identify areas where the interface
                and logic could be improved for clarity and reliability.

              <p class="mb-0">
                Eight participants aged 25–35 took part in the testing. I
                selected users with varying levels of technical proficiency,
                ranging from casual web users to those with more advanced
                skills. Their geography knowledge also varied, from limited to
                more advanced understanding, to reflect the diverse audience
                likely to play the quiz. Testing was conducted across different
                devices and screen sizes to capture a broad range of user
                behaviours and experiences.

                  Some users discovered that by rapidly clicking or manipulating

                  which also affected the score incorrectly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Feedback on whether an answer was correct wasn’t always

                </li>
                <li>
                  A few participants mentioned that the progression criteria

              <p class="mb-0">
                Based on user feedback, I added the score display to the top of
                the screen so users could track their progress in real time,
                rather than waiting until the end of each round. To improve
                clarity and reduce confusion, I also introduced feedback phrases
                like “Sorry!” or “Correct!” to make it instantly clear whether
                an answer was correct. Additionally, I implemented further event
                listener removal on answer buttons to prevent them from being
                clicked multiple times or manipulated, ensuring the integrity of
                both the gameplay and scoring system. These changes helped
                create a more transparent, responsive, and user-friendly
                experience.

                Usability testing revealed subtle but important issues I hadn’t
                expected, such as users manipulating buttons or struggling to
                understand feedback after answering. It reinforced how valuable
                it is to test early with a variety of users and not assume that
                logic or visuals are always clear. These insights pushed me to
                refine the game's clarity, improve interaction feedback, and
                strengthen accessibility across devices. Overall, it was a great
                reminder that thoughtful iteration makes a big difference in the
                user experience.

                To ensure a clean developer handoff, I focused on keeping both
                the design and code highly organized and easy to follow. I
                documented key interaction patterns, design decisions, and
                functionality to make it simple for another developer to
                understand and build on. The JavaScript logic was kept modular
                and clearly commented, and the HTML and CSS followed a
                consistent structure for easy styling updates. Git and GitHub
                were used throughout development to track progress and manage
                versions. The final build was tested across browsers and screen
                sizes, and deployed using a simple process that makes future
                updates quick and low-risk.

                I conducted both manual testing and moderated usability sessions
                to ensure Geo Quiz performed reliably across desktop and mobile
                environments. Manual testing helped validate core functionality,
                including scoring accuracy, button states, and level
                progression. Usability testing offered valuable feedback on how
                real users interacted with the game, highlighting issues such as
                unclear feedback messaging and edge-case bugs related to button
                behaviour. These insights allowed me to refine the user
                experience, strengthen the game logic, and improve the overall
                stability before final deployment.

          This project was a huge milestone for me as it was my first ever
          JavaScript game. It was incredibly rewarding to not only learn the
          language but to apply it in building something interactive that real
          users could play and enjoy. Seeing the logic come to life through code
          gave me a whole new appreciation for how much thought goes into even
          the simplest interactions. I learned a lot, not just about JavaScript
          itself, but about how real users interact with digital products in
          unexpected ways. Usability testing revealed things I hadn’t
          considered, and I saw firsthand how important accessibility, feedback,
          and mobile responsiveness really are. Moving forward, I plan to
          improve my wireframing process with high-fidelity prototypes earlier
          in the project and continue refining both my front-end skills and my
          approach to human-centred design.
