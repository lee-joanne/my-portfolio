        <p>
          For my first JavaScript project at Code Institute, I developed Geo
          Quiz, an interactive quiz game that challenges users with
          geography-based questions of increasing difficulty. The game features
          dynamic score tracking, responsive design, and smooth user
          interactions powered by JavaScript. This project helped solidify my
          understanding of core programming concepts such as event handling,
          conditional logic, and DOM manipulation. I was proud to earn a
          <strong>Merit</strong> grade for this work.

        <h1 class="fw-bold mb-2">The Problem</h1>
        <p>
          Many JavaScript-based games, especially those targeting beginners,
          tend to suffer from buggy functionality, lack of proper error
          handling, and poorly structured code. Additionally, they often fail to
          implement progressive difficulty, which can lead to user boredom and
          reduced engagement over time. There's a clear need for a well-built,
          scalable and simple game that not only provides an engaging and
          educational experience, but also follows modern JavaScript best
          practices, including clean code, thoughtful error handling, and a
          difficulty curve that keeps players challenged and motivated.

        <p>
          To address the common issues of unreliable code and stagnant
          difficulty in JavaScript games, I built a geography-based game, called
          Geo Quiz, using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and
          <strong>JavaScript</strong>. The game was designed to scale in
          difficulty as users progress, maintaining engagement while testing
          their geography knowledge. I implemented thorough error handling and
          followed front-end best practices to ensure clean, maintainable code.
          To validate its performance and user experience, I conducted both
          usability testing and manual testing, using real feedback to refine
          the interface, logic, and overall gameplay for a smooth and enjoyable
          experience.

            <p>
              As a solo designer and developer, Geo Quiz was my first JavaScript
              project. I kicked off the process by researching UX principles,
              game design patterns, and JavaScript best practices. I took notes
              on what makes quiz games engaging and accessible, then sketched
              out user flows and wireframes. Before diving into JavaScript, I
              built a responsive HTML/CSS layout, then incrementally added
              interactivity, difficulty scaling, and feedback mechanisms. This
              project helped me apply my research in a practical way while
              deepening my front-end development skills.

            <h3 class="fw-bold">Target Users & Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              Geo Quiz was designed for casual players and beginners seeking a
              quick, engaging challenge. I identified this audience by
              researching trends in online quiz games and focusing on
              accessibility and ease of use. The game is fully responsive across
              devices, with clear feedback, helpful error handling, and a
              smooth, frustration-free experience that encourages replayability.

            <h3 class="fw-bold">Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              For the competitive analysis of Geo Quiz, I reviewed a range of
              beginner-friendly JavaScript quiz games. While many were creative,
              they often lacked proper error handling, had minimal difficulty
              progression, or included bugs due to weak game logic. I also
              noticed that many were themed around niche topics like TV shows or
              pop culture, which can limit their appeal. To ensure broader
              accessibility, I chose a geography-based theme, which is something
              universally relatable, and focused on building a clean, reliable
              game that offers a smooth, engaging experience for all users.

          <h3 class="fw-bold">Wireframes</h3>
          <p>
            For this project, I chose to start with paper wireframes to maintain
            focus on designing a clear and intuitive user flow. This hands-on
            method allowed me to thoughtfully plan error handling and user
            interactions early on, helping to ensure a smooth and
            frustration-free experience before beginning development.

            <h4>Paper Wireframes</h4>
            <p>
              I started with hand-drawn wireframes to map out layout and user
              flow concepts without focusing on detailed visuals. This approach
              allowed me to quickly brainstorm and sketch essential screens like
              the homepage, how instructions will be portrayed to the user, the
              game layout, and how the buttons will be interacted.

          <p>
            I created the style guide to reflect a calm, accessible look that
            supports the geography theme. Using a harmonious palette of blues,
            white, and black, I highlighted key elements like buttons and
            containers in blue, ensured readability with white text, and used
            black accents for clarity. I chose <strong>Dosis</strong>, a playful
            and readable rounded sans-serif font, to match the game’s friendly
            tone. The background image of blue skies and Greek architecture
            reinforces the theme while keeping the layout clean and welcoming.

              The colour palette for Geo Quiz features calming blues inspired by
              the background image of Greece, with lighter blue used for main
              containers and buttons, and darker blue to highlight key actions.
              White text ensures readability and accessibility, while some black
              accents emphasize interactive elements. This combination creates a
              clear, inviting, and user-friendly interface that fits the
              geography theme.

                I began by writing small, focused JavaScript functions that each
                performed a single, clear task. This modular approach helped
                ensure clean, testable logic and made it easier to debug and
                build upon. From there, I gradually layered on additional
                functionality, keeping the code organized and easy to follow. I
                maintained consistent structure in the HTML and CSS for smooth
                styling updates and documented key interaction patterns and
                design decisions to support a clean developer handoff. Git and
                GitHub were used throughout to manage version control, and the
                final build was tested across browsers and screen sizes before
                being deployed in a way that supports fast, low-risk updates.

                The primary goal of testing Geo Quiz was to ensure key
                functionalities worked reliably across real-world scenarios.
                With the first deployment as my prototype, I focused on
                verifying that questions shuffled correctly, answer buttons
                disabled appropriately after selection, and the score accurately
                updated. Additionally, I tested that users were correctly
                passing or failing each level based on their performance. The
                game’s responsiveness was also evaluated across various screen
                sizes and devices to ensure a smooth experience for all users.
                This comprehensive testing helped identify and resolve issues
                related to usability, responsiveness, and game logic under
                diverse conditions.

                I conducted <strong>moderated</strong> usability tests lasting
                <strong>10–15 minutes</strong> each, where I guided users
                through a series of tasks and questions. Participants were asked
                to perform actions such as finding out how many points are
                needed to reach level 3, attempting to manipulate the answer
                buttons, answering all questions correctly, and intentionally
                failing. These sessions provided valuable insights into how
                users interact with the game’s mechanics and helped identify
                areas where the interface and logic could be improved for
                clarity and reliability.

        <p>
          The final Geo Quiz is a well-structured, engaging JavaScript quiz game
          that challenges users with progressively harder geography questions.
          Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game features a responsive
          design that works smoothly across devices, clear feedback after each
          question, and a scoring system that motivates continued play.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usability testing revealed subtle issues such as unclear feedback and
          score manipulation bugs. These insights guided key improvements,
          including enhanced visual cues for answers, stricter control to
          prevent score changes after submission, and clearer instructions on
          level progression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regular manual testing across multiple browsers and screen sizes
          ensured consistent performance and accessibility. User feedback
          confirmed the positive impact of these refinements, resulting in a
          polished, enjoyable, and educational experience that encourages
          repeated engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          My focused efforts on user-centred design and development earned me a
          <strong>Merit</strong> grade for the project.

        <p class="mb-0">
          This project was a huge milestone for me as it was my first ever
          JavaScript game. It was incredibly rewarding to not only learn the
          language but to apply it in building something interactive that real
          users could play and enjoy. Seeing the logic come to life through code
          gave me a whole new appreciation for how much thought goes into even
          the simplest interactions. I learned a lot, not just about JavaScript
          itself, but about how real users interact with digital products in
          unexpected ways. Usability testing revealed things I hadn’t
          considered, and I saw firsthand how important accessibility, feedback,
          and mobile responsiveness really are. Moving forward, I plan to
          improve my wireframing process with high-fidelity prototypes earlier
          in the project and continue refining both my front-end skills and my
          approach to human-centred design.
