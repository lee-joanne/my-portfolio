          In this solo project, I designed and built Yakker, a minimalist,
          anonymous microblogging platform focused on creating a low-pressure
          social space. Through exploring the challenges of authentication, API
          development, and front-end state management, I crafted a clean,
          distraction-free feed where users can share short posts and follow
          others without the pressure of personal branding or identity. The
          project emphasized simplicity and content-driven interaction, removing
          common social media barriers like email verification and profile
          requirements.

        <p>
          In an increasingly loud and identity-driven digital world, many users
          crave a space to share thoughts without the pressure of building their
          personal branding. While major platforms like Twitter offer real-time
          interaction, they often come with complex algorithms, content
          visibility issues, and identity-driven engagement. I wanted to explore
          what it would look like to build a stripped-back, community-focused
          social media platform, one where users could post freely, follow
          others, and engage without the social pressure of being "seen." Yakker
          was born out of a personal challenge: could I design and build a
          working social platform from scratch, with a focus on anonymity and
          simplicity?

        <p>
          Yakker is a Twitter-style microblogging platform built using
          <strong>React</strong>
          on the front end and <strong>Django REST Framework</strong> on the
          back end. It allows users to sign up, follow others, and share short
          posts in a clean, anonymous feed. The design is intentionally minimal
          to prioritize content over identity. There are no email verifications
          or required personal details. Just text-based interactions that
          emphasize conversation. Building Yakker helped me dive deep into
          authentication, API development, and front-end state management, while
          also exploring the UX implications of designing for low-pressure
          social interaction.

            <p>
              As a solo designer and developer for this project, I began by
              defining clear goals for Yakker: to create a lightweight,
              anonymous social media platform inspired by Twitter, but without
              the pressure of personal branding. I conducted a competitive audit
              of popular platforms, documenting early assumptions and
              identifying critical research questions to guide the build.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3 class="fw-bold">Target Users & Privacy</h3>
            <p>
              I identified my target users as people who actively use social
              media platforms but are highly protective of their personal data
              and privacy. These include students, professionals, and casual
              users who seek a space to express themselves freely without the
              pressure of revealing their identity or sharing sensitive
              information.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3 class="fw-bold">Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              I examined onboarding and interaction patterns across platforms
              like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit, and found that lengthy sign-up
              flows often lead to user drop-off. Privacy-conscious users, in
              particular, experience added friction when asked to provide
              personal details like email addresses. Yakker addresses this by
              minimizing barriers, allowing users to post immediately after
              sign-up without requiring email verification.

          <h3 class="fw-bold">Wireframes</h3>
          <p>
            In the early stages of the design process, I adopted a mobile-first
            approach by sketching out key screens on paper. This allowed me to
            quickly visualize core user flows and focus on content hierarchy,
            clarity, and essential interactions. After solidifying the basic
            structure, I translated these sketches into digital low-fidelity
            wireframes using Whimsical. These wireframes helped define layout
            and user flow while keeping the visuals intentionally minimal. Since
            the primary goal of this project was to deepen my development
            skills, I chose to move directly into development after the
            low-fidelity stage. I used the wireframes as a functional blueprint
            to guide the front-end build and ensure that the app’s key features,
            posting, following users, and engaging anonymously, were implemented
            with a clear and consistent structure. While I didn’t create
            high-fidelity mockups, I continuously refined UI components during
            development to balance usability with simplicity.

            <h4>Paper Wireframes</h4>
            <p>
              I began with hand-drawn wireframes to quickly explore layout and
              flow options without committing to visuals. This helped me rapidly
              ideate and sketch out key screens such as the homepage, user feed,
              and post interaction views.

              After validating core flows, I moved into digital low-fidelity
              wireframes using Whimsical. I quickly visualized the layout of the
              social feed, creating posts, commenting on other user's posts, and
              the user's profile page, ensuring all user needs are met.

              digital wireframes for desktop, introducing more accurate sizing

              post layout, profile summaries, and feed structure.

          <h3 class="fw-bold">Database Model</h3>
          <p>
            After completing the wireframes, I used Whimsical to create the
            relational database model, outlining the core entities and their
            relationships. This step helped me visualize how different pieces of
            data would interact within the system, ensuring a logical and
            scalable structure before moving on to development. Mapping the
            model early on also made it easier to identify potential issues and
            refine the data flow across the application.

        </div>

        <div class="row align-items-center mb-5">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h4>Digital Model</h4>
            <p>
              The final database model included five main tables: User, Post,
              Comment, Yakfile, and Following. Using the digital model, I was
              able to clearly define the data types and relationships between
              tables. For example, one-to-many relationships between Users and
              Posts or Posts and Comments, and many-to-many relationships for
              reyakks to posts. Each table was mapped out with specific fields
              such as unique IDs, image uploads, text fields, and foreign keys
              to ensure proper data linkage. This step provided a clear
              structural foundation that made implementing the back-end logic
              more straightforward and efficient.

            platform’s casual and community-driven vibe. It features two primary
            fonts sourced from Google Fonts: <strong>Fredoka One</strong>, a
            playful and bold cursive used for headers, post titles, and
            navigation to establish a clear visual hierarchy; and
            <strong>Raleway</strong>, a clean and simple sans-serif chosen for
            body text and longer content to maximize readability.

            <p>
              The colour palette, inspired by a scheme developed by Logo.com,
              strategically uses a primary colour for most text, a secondary
              colour to highlight interactive elements like links and buttons on
              hover, and an accent colour to emphasize key details such as
              usernames and active navigation links. Together, these choices
              ensure a cohesive and approachable aesthetic that supports
              Yakker’s goal of fostering open, low-pressure social interaction.

                I developed the Django REST API in a separate GitHub repository
                to keep the back end and front end decoupled and modular. On the
                front end, I used React with React Router DOM for client-side
                navigation and React Bootstrap for streamlined UI components.
                Axios was used to handle all HTTP requests, allowing seamless
                communication between the front end and the API. This setup
                enabled efficient state management, component reuse, and faster
                debugging throughout the build process.

        <p>
          Although the live deployment has since expired, I documented key
          screenshots of the final product to showcase Yakker’s core interface,
          including responsive layouts and essential features like posting,
          following, and viewing profiles. The final build stayed true to the
          platform’s original vision: a clean, anonymous social experience
          designed to reduce pressure and prioritize authentic expression.
          Thoughtful UI choices such as soft tones, intuitive navigation, and
          minimal distractions helped create a space that felt both modern and
          approachable. As both the designer and developer, I brought this
          concept to life from the ground up, translating my wireframes directly
          into functional code. The process deepened my skills in front-end
          architecture, API integration, and human-centred design.

        <p>
          Working on this project was a genuinely enjoyable experience. I
          appreciated the opportunity to take ownership of both the design and
          development process, which allowed me to fully immerse myself in
          building the product end-to-end. However, working solo also
          highlighted how valuable it would be to collaborate within a larger
          team environment. Having dedicated designers and developers to
          brainstorm with, exchange ideas, and iterate collectively would bring
          fresh perspectives and help push the project even further. I am
          especially eager to work in a more Agile setup, where cross-functional
          collaboration and continuous feedback drive the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the design side, I see great value in investing more time into
          creating high-fidelity wireframes and prototypes before diving deep
          into development. This would help double-check that all user needs are
          met early on, reducing the risk of costly changes later and ensuring a
          smoother development workflow. Overall, this project has strengthened
          my passion for building meaningful products, and I look forward to
          contributing in team-based environments where I can learn from others
          and help deliver even better solutions.
