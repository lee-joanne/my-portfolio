            <h2 class="fw-bold">Problem</h2>
            <p>
              In an increasingly noisy and identity-driven digital world, many
              users crave a space to share thoughts without the pressure of
              building a public persona. While major platforms like Twitter
              offer real-time interaction, they often come with complex
              algorithms, content visibility issues, and identity-driven
              engagement. I wanted to explore what it would look like to build a
              stripped-back, community-focused social media platform, one where
              users could post freely, follow others, and engage without the
              social pressure of being "seen." Yakker was born out of a personal
              challenge: could I design and build a working social platform from
              scratch, with a focus on anonymity and simplicity?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h2 class="fw-bold">Solution</h2>
            <p>
              Yakker is a Twitter-style microblogging platform built using React
              on the front end and Django REST Framework on the back end. It
              allows users to sign up, follow others, and share short posts in a
              clean, anonymous feed. The design is intentionally minimal to
              prioritize content over identity. There are no email verifications
              or required personal details. Just text-based interactions that
              emphasize conversation. Building Yakker helped me dive deep into
              authentication, API development, and front-end state management,
              while also exploring the UX implications of designing for
              low-pressure social interaction.

            <h2 class="fw-bold">Kickoff</h2>
            <p>
              As a solo designer and developer for this project, I began by
              defining clear goals for Yakker: to create a lightweight,
              anonymous social media platform inspired by Twitter, but without
              the pressure of personal branding. I conducted a competitive audit
              of popular platforms, documenting early assumptions and
              identifying critical research questions to guide the build.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h2 class="fw-bold">Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>
              I examined onboarding and interaction patterns across platforms
              like Twitter, Threads, and Reddit. A key insight was that users
              often drop off during lengthy sign-up flows. Yakker’s approach
              prioritizes minimal friction by allowing immediate posting after
              sign-up.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h2 class="fw-bold">Target Users & Privacy</h2>
            <p>
              Yakker is aimed at users who want to post freely without being
              tied to their identity — including students, professionals, and
              casual users. I also considered the importance of limiting
              personal data collection, keeping privacy and safety top of mind.

              <li>
                Users are more likely to engage when onboarding is simple and

          <h2 class="fw-bold">Wireframes</h2>
          <p>
            In the early stages of the design process, I adopted a mobile-first
            approach by sketching out key screens on paper. This allowed me to
            quickly visualize core user flows and focus on content hierarchy,
            clarity, and essential interactions. After solidifying the basic
            structure, I translated these sketches into digital low-fidelity
            wireframes using Whimsical. These wireframes helped define layout
            and user flow while keeping the visuals intentionally minimal. Since
            the primary goal of this project was to deepen my development
            skills, I chose to move directly into development after the
            low-fidelity stage. I used the wireframes as a functional blueprint
            to guide the front-end build and ensure that the app’s key features,
            posting, following users, and engaging anonymously, were implemented
            with a clear and consistent structure. While I didn’t create
            high-fidelity mockups, I continuously refined UI components during
            development to balance usability with simplicity.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h4>Paper Wireframes</h4>
            <p>
              I began with hand-drawn wireframes to quickly explore layout and
              flow options without committing to visuals. This helped me rapidly
              ideate and sketch out key screens such as the homepage, user feed,
              and post interaction views.

              After validating core flows, I moved into digital low-fidelity
              wireframes using Whimsical. I quickly visualized the layout of the
              social feed, creating posts, commenting on other user's posts, and
              the user's profile page, ensuring all user needs are met.

              To refine the layout for desktop screens, I transitioned into the
              digital wireframes for desktop, introducing more accurate sizing

              post layout, profile summaries, and feed structure.

            Google Fonts: <strong>Fredoka One</strong>, a playful and bold
            cursive used for headers, post titles, and navigation to establish a
            clear visual hierarchy; and <strong>Raleway</strong>, a clean and
            simple sans-serif chosen for body text and longer content to
            maximize readability.

              The logo was created using Logo.com. The goal was to feature a

              The color palette, inspired by a scheme developed by Logo.com,
              strategically uses a primary color for most text, a secondary
              color to highlight interactive elements like links and buttons on
              hover, and an accent color to emphasize key details such as
              usernames and active navigation links. Together, these choices
              ensure a cohesive and approachable aesthetic that supports
              Yakker’s goal of fostering open, low-pressure social interaction.

          <p>
            Although mockups are no longer available due to deployment expiry, I
            captured key screenshots of the final built product before it went
            offline. These images showcase the core interface, including the
            responsive layout, and essential user interactions such as posting,
            following, and profile viewing. The final design reflects the
            original goals of the platform, a clean, minimal, and anonymous
            social media experience, with thoughtful UI choices like soft tones,
            clear typography, and intuitive flows. As both the designer and
            developer, I translated my low-fidelity wireframes directly into
            code, focusing on responsiveness, usability, and aligning
            functionality with user stories defined early in the process.

                I ensured smooth handoff by keeping design and code aligned,
                documenting assets and style guides, and organizing reusable
                components. Manual testing across devices ensured
                responsiveness. Git and GitHub were used extensively, and code
                quality was maintained through ESLint and validation tools.
                Final deployment was on Heroku with continuous deployment from
                GitHub.

        <p>
          Working on this project was a genuinely enjoyable experience. I
          appreciated the opportunity to take ownership of both the design and
          development process, which allowed me to fully immerse myself in
          building the product end-to-end. However, working solo also
          highlighted how valuable it would be to collaborate within a larger
          team environment. Having dedicated designers and developers to
          brainstorm with, exchange ideas, and iterate collectively would bring
          fresh perspectives and help push the project even further. I am
          especially eager to work in a more Agile setup, where cross-functional
          collaboration and continuous feedback drive the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the design side, I see great value in investing more time into
          creating high-fidelity wireframes and prototypes before diving deep
          into development. This would help double-check that all user needs are
          met early on, reducing the risk of costly changes later and ensuring a
          smoother development workflow. Overall, this project has strengthened
          my passion for building meaningful products, and I look forward to
          contributing in team-based environments where I can learn from others
          and help deliver even better solutions.
